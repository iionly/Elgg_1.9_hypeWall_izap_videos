Changelog
=========

3.0.0
-----

- Updated for Elgg 3 and hypeWall release 6.2.0 (so you need both for this version),
- Quicklink of the hypeWall plugin for adding videos to iZAP Videos is kept unchanged (no longer necessary to add an entry to the hypeWall input form to add videos),
- Instead of the quicklinks of the hypeWall plugin for Tidypics to add albums (working) and photos (not working) a new quicklink is added to open the "Upload photos" popup of Tidpyics to select the album the photos should be uploaded to or to select the option to add a new photo album.

2.3.4
-----

- Checked and fixed compatibility with current hypeWall release (5.2.0).

2.3.3
-----

- Requires Elgg 2.3.0 at minimum,
- No longer load Elgg's lighbox JS and CSS because they are loaded by core on all pages now anyway,
- Added missing brackets in elgg_get_logged_in_user_guid() function call.

1.9.2
-----

- Verified that it works on Elgg 1.9 - 1.12 and 2.0 (should also work on future Elgg 2.X versions) - tested with hypeWall version 4.3.0,
- composer.json added,
- Added support for Tidypics, i.e. if Tidypics is installed a menu item is added to the hypeWall menu for quick access to image uploading,
- Renaming of plugin folder (and plugin id) from hypeWall_izap_videos to hypewall_izap_videos_tidypics because Packagist doesn't allow upper case letter in repo names (without renaming a composer based install wouldn't have been possible to offer) and to indicate the support of Tidypics.
