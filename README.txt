This plugin adds a menu item to the hypeWall menu that directs a user to the 'Add new video' page of the iZAP Videos plugin (tested only with my revised version of iZAP Videos!).

In the same way as it's done here for the 'Add new video' menu item other new menu items could get added to the hypeWall menu, too, using this plugin as starting point.
